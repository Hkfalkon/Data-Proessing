# Data-Proessing


# Marking criteria:
Your research question, the objective must be clear and unambiguous. The research question must have an appropriate complexity, i.e., it Is not overly simple or complicated. An indication of a question too simple is one that requires only one or two simple analyses to answer and an indication of a question too ambitious is one that needs too many techniques outside the scope of this subject to answer.

Are the identified audience appropriate?

How well you understand your dataset. This includes being able to describe it correctly and succinctly, identify its limitations, and propose meaningful analyses based on it. 

The scope of your data wrangling techniques. This includes how you justify the usefulness of the techniques for later analysis.

How many techniques you use on your dataset, your justifications for the techniques are useful and necessary for later analyses.

The quantity and quality of your data analyses. There is no `right' number of analyses you need to do, In showing the quality of your techniques, you first need to explain why they are useful for answering your research question. Then you should be able to demonstrate your understanding of each technique by explaining what it does, what are the key results and what limitations it might have based on your dataset(s). 

The quality of your written communication. This includes your choice of plots, the language and style of your writing and how you structure your final report. Although you can choose to write your report in any suitable way, we suggest you follow the above seven main points in that order.

# Objecttives
The objectives of this assignment are
To gain an appreciation of open datasets and ask meaningful questions to them;
To practise a variety of data wrangling skills you have learned on real-world datasets;
To build an data pipeline as a data scientist in training;
To gain experience in communication and group work, including writing a report, collaborating with your
teammates, and defending the importance of your research; and
To practise the task of peer review on other teams' projects, and learn how that can be beneficial to your
skill set.
